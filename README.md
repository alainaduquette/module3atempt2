# module3atempt2
HI to whoever this my concern - I finally had the opprotunity to take the feedback given and make the necessary changes.
I did end up not succesfully getting the average change formula for the pyBank. I would really appreciate having the proper code for refrence.
I also was not able to successfully copy one line from the pypoll result to the text file.
For both of the above issues I did comment out my code for the 2 sections I struggled with to allow the rest to function.
Thanks so much
